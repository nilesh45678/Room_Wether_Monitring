# Room_Wether_Monitring

The IoT Room Environment Monitoring System is a project that utilizes the ESP8266 Wi-Fi module and DHT11 sensor to sense and monitor the temperature and humidity of a room. The collected data is then uploaded to the ThingSpeak platform, where it is visualized in graph form for easy monitoring and analysis.
